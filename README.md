# quantum-tunneling-single-barrier
A simulation tool for studying quantum tunneling phenomena. Analyzes how transmission probability varies with barrier width (L), barrier height (V0), and incident particle energy (E) using two computational methods: analytical approach and transfer matrix approach.
